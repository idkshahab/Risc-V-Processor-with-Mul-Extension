RISC-V Multiplier & Single-Cycle Processor Integration

Course Project – Computer System Architecture (CSA), 3rd Semester

This repository contains the implementation of a RISC-V compliant multiplier unit developed in SystemVerilog, supporting the M-extension multiplication instructions. The multiplier was designed at the RTL level and integrated into a RISC-V single-cycle processor, enabling correct execution of multiplication instructions within the processor datapath.
